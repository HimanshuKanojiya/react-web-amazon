# Amazon Web Clone

This project is clone of Amazon Website, where we are trying to create almost similar replica to actual Amazon Web. It will have all same features as Amazon has in their website

In this project, we have used these technologies:

- React Js, version 17
- Typescript
- Styled Components
- Redux, and redux toolkit
- Firebase (for authentication purposes)
- JIRA & Scrum (for project management)

**Current Sprint:** 5 (Tickets: 8, Ongoing 1, Finished 0)

### Instrunctions to use this project:

As of now, project is already hosted, and in ongoing development so links to staging/development is hidden by default.
Production link is live but it does not have much updated changes (for now, waiting to finish 4 sprints tasks)

In case, if you want to run this project in local, you need to do (for now, as it is in active development):

- Clone the repository
- run 'yarn install'
- Create any testing branch (add 'testing/' as prefix) from 'master' branch
- Run 'git fetch --all' (optional but recommended to fetch all changes)
- Run 'git merge origin/develop'
- Now, to install latest packages you need to run 'yarn install' again
- Run 'yarn start' to run the project
- Once above steps done, then visit this URL in browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

**Project staging/development link:** [Staing link](https://react-web-stg-amazon.vercel.app/)
